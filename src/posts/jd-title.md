After 2 years of working in admin / data entry, I was stuck. However, scared to leave a “stable and well-paid job” and having no industry experience elsewhere, I was hesitant to quit.

I decided to take work leave to join a 10 day meditation course (Vipasanna) in the Blue Mountains to help decide my next step. Some of the course rules include: no technology and speaking to others for the duration of the course. The purpose of these rules are to minimise distractions and allow you to be in your own spiritual journey / maximise the benefits from the course. This was ideal for me to do some personal reflection and clear thinking. I was able to finish the course, despite it being highly challenging (mentally). I came out enlightened and with a clear mind.

I handed in my resignation and booked a solo one way ticket to Nepal and planned to eventually make my way towards Vietnam to visit my motherland for the first time. Being 23 at the time and not knowing what to do next (career-wise), besides not being in finance, I took it as an opportunity to explore SE Asia for however long I felt whilst I still had my youth.

Travelling solo is truly a different experience. I didn’t have to worry about someone else and had the freedom to do whatever I wanted. Plus it takes you out of your comfort zone to interact more with others.

My travelling highlights are:

* Getting hit by a donkey whilst trekking in Nepal and almost falling off the cliff
* Trekking Himalayas in India with a Lithuanian and an Indian
* Learning to ride a classic SE Asian motorbike, and doing a solo motorbike trip from Saigon to Hanoi
* Getting lost in a rural area on my motorbike trip to Hoi An and having the challenge of interacting/understanding the middle Vietnamese accent of locals when asking for help
* Staying with Vietnamese university students in Hanoi and spending time getting to know the local culture from a similar age group
* Appreciating how locals live and how they are grateful for the simplest things

# After hiatus-ing for about a year, I felt content and once again, needed to move on. I always had an interest in coding, but honestly felt I was never smart enough to pick it up easily (aka too lazy to put in the hard work), but post-travelling I felt like I had an opportunity to start fresh and being that I just fluffed my life around for a year, I’m now determined to put in the hard work.

So… sitting in my hostel in Hanoi, I did some online research, and stumbled across an intensive 6 month web development bootcamp at a place called **Coder Academy**… starting in 2 weeks.

Monday — Friday.

9–5.

6 months.

Intensive? Yes pleaseeeeee, this is what I need in my life right now.

After reading course reviews from past candidates plus more research, I was keen!

Phone interview > successful > ticket booked to Sydney

**Coding Experience**

There were a few times where I was able to pick up concepts, but then my confidence would drop right after when a new concept was introduced and once again, felt like I knew nothing. However, there are definitely moments where it all just clicks and it feels amazing!! The learning experience truly is a rollercoaster experience.

I am now in my final week of my course and as part of my assignment, I’m now implementing / picking up things I thought were impossible. Actually feels pretty amazing to see how far I’ve come in such a short period of time :)

To add to my success, I really have to advocate the Coder Academy’s educators and the learning environment they construct. From the teachers across the students, I can see why bootcamps are so effective. The difference in experience here compared to university is immense. You’re surrounded by passionate teachers and driven students that are in similar shoes to you\
( experiencing a career change or quarter life crisis 😅 )

Alright, if you’ve somehow managed to get this far, thanks for sticking around, and I hope you enjoyed my story.

In short, here are my key takeaways:

* If you’re not passionate in your career field, take ownership and act. The average person spends 90 000 hours working in their life, surely it makes sense to find something you enjoy doing right?!
* Travelling’s amazing, and even better… *solo* *travelling*. If you haven’t experienced that yet, I highly recommend doing it at least once. It’s a whole different experience in itself
* If you’re interesting in coding, go for it and don’t be intimidated by the technicalness, the initial learning curve may be tough, but you will feel SO rewarded once you get past it and start building apps that work! (I think bootcamps are effective in helping you build that *foundation* and fast tracking your knowledge, however be prepared to smash out the hard work!!)
